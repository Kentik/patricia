Patricia Tree
=============

Go implementation of a [patricia tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) (radix tree with radix=2), useful for tagging IP addresses with CIDRs

A tree implementation is generated for each of Go's built-in types to help prevent garbage from building up across interface{} conversion.
